# Brief Review

# Intro:-
Blockchain Technology is a method of recording information under a decentralised system which is impossible to change, manipulate or hacked. Blockchain is a  distributed ledger that duplicates and distribute the transactional information to all the connected networks. It is a structure that stores all records of transaction in a single block which is connected to the next block of transaction in a chain manner which is termed as Blockchain. This storage is known as Digital Ledger. It is highly secured, distributed, immutable, decentralised and transparent.

Every transaction in a ledger is authorised by the digital signature of the owner which authenticates the transaction and safeguards from tampering. Hence, its highly secured.

# Structure of Blockchain:-

A Block consists of three major components:
1) Header - contains metadata such as timpestamp and previous block's hash.
2) Data section - contains the actual information such as transactions and smart contracts.
3) Hash - its a unique cryptographic value of the entire block for verification purposes.

# Process of Transaction:-

When two people want to perform a transaction using their private and public keys, respectively, the first party would attach the transaction data to the second party's public key. The block includes a timestamp, a digital signature, and other crucial details. It should be emphasised that the block does not contain information on the parties to the transaction's identities. The block is then sent around the entire network, and when the correct user uses his private key to match it with the block, the transaction is successfully completed.

The Blockchain is able to record financial transactions as well as prperties, cars, and so on which is known as smart contracts.
