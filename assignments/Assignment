# Introduction
In this assignment, you will be using your knowledge of the C++ programming language to implement a simple blockchain. A blockchain is a digital ledger of transactions that is decentralized and secure. Each block in the chain contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, along with the current transactions.

# Requirements
Implement a basic blockchain data structure in C++. The blockchain should consist of blocks, each with a unique hash and a pointer to the previous block in the chain.
Each block should contain a list of transactions, represented as a linked list.
Implement a function to add a new block to the chain. This function should take a list of transactions as input, calculate the hash of the previous block, and add the new block to the chain.
Implement a function to validate the blockchain. This function should traverse the chain and verify that each block's hash matches the previous block's hash.
Test your blockchain implementation by adding some transactions and validating the chain.
Research and write a brief report on the security implications of using a blockchain for financial transactions.
Submission Guidelines
Fork this repository and create a new branch for your work.
Create a folder with your name and place all your files inside it.
Write all your code in C++ language.
Include a README.md file explaining how to compile and run your code.
Write a brief report on the security implications of using a blockchain for financial transactions and include it in your folder.
